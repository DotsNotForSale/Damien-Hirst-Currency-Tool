║  If the spirits of the dying could stand at my feet   ║
║  Never seemed like the time for this conversation     ║
║  So you talk about love, conversation, and money      ║
║  Very soon will we let the stars start to fade        ║
║  That deep inside you've got lots of trouble          ║
║  Way down here—there's a hole in the heart            ║
║  You're still on the verge of getting higher          ║
║  This old art: You're always so interesting           ║
║  Did you watch pornstars when you were young?         ║
║  Jump backwards - I see you're so beautiful           ║
║  Make those sounds just a little further away         ║
║  Didn't you know you were coming all the way?         ║
║  They know you're looking through your lens           ║
║  Those flowers that used to lie on the ground         ║
║  Holy it's not holy it's clean's straight             ║
║  I've spent the last century stranded alone           ║
║  You're upset, we can just sit here and weep          ║
║  They're supposed to be like an ordinary day          ║
║  Restlessness is what keeps men from earning          ║
║  Hope I'll be around to add some perspective          ║
║  You can get paid more than I'm asking for            ║
║  I just want to watch the streetlights shift          ║
║  Till the soul of his dreams starts to shake          ║
║  He's already been awake in another dream             ║
║  That year the masters of archery were back           ║
║  Look what you did when you took care of me           ║
║  But where do you get the government money?           ║
║  Eyes open and pure and what is there of me           ║
║  Don't lose sight of what we all stand on             ║
║  You're supposed to be a sorrowful artist             ║
║  Wouldn't it be funny if he's loved again             ║
║  Your lives don't seem all that different             ║
║  You look like you, or you don't come close           ║
║  But all it took was a little fella singing           ║
║  Young blood's wounds are running like hail           ║
║  What if it's broken down and torn apart?             ║
║  Look at the snake like you've never seen             ║
║  The tension keeps running through my veins           ║
║  The speed with which time keeps repeating            ║
║  And what is darkness until the last scene            ║
║  But, won't you know that I gave you this?            ║
║  What I once thought to be a beautiful art            ║
║  Saying he won't take me if he's right                ║
║  Isn't it better for everybody to be safe?            ║
║  You'll be making my heart full of nails              ║
║  The lyrics to all the things I had to say            ║
║  I can feel you're close to getting high              ║
║  We'll be moving in different directions              ║
║  The water here, the bones under the paint            ║
║  Killing all that nobody's understanding              ║
║  My mouth is open to those who're afraid              ║
║  You say it with that feeling in your eyes            ║
║  My beheaded title: Findings from eternity            ║
║  Finally liberty if you get back on stage             ║
║  Oh my god; I know you and I live by fate             ║
║  It keeps your hot lips from looking wild             ║
║  Just to try and keep the honeymoon quiet             ║
║  And then I was like, What are you doing?             ║
║  The angels say the world is never to end             ║
║  A policeman walkin' by at the tender age             ║
║  First I spent my life pursuing a mystery             ║
║  The machines won't seem so complicated               ║
║  Where they lived the rest of their lives             ║
║  I think he says it's for your cup of tea             ║
║  Please, I've got your little boy's money             ║
║  I'll not keep my head out of the water               ║
║  Looking for you's last minute overture               ║
║  Been waiting for you I'm not satisfied               ║
║  Cool; you're trying your best together               ║
║  And I know this because I've got to it               ║
║  The action is good, that you can breathe             ║
║  This is the coolest movie I've ever seen             ║
║  Tell me she's telling me her true name               ║
║  What do we mean by saying we don't care?             ║
║  I say to myself that we're all friends               ║
║  I don't know who I'm gonna belong to                 ║
║  Concoct one thing and pass it off as art             ║
║  Looking at you on a dark and rainy night             ║
║  You're talking about the immense spark               ║
║  A message that appears in the blue skies             ║
║  Money will never go where it needs to go             ║
║  Please just find me the one in your life             ║
║  It took me from living out with my mind              ║
║  But it was the first time we all talked              ║
║  I don't understand why you're dying                  ║
║  I don't know if you were good or evil                ║
║  The moonbeam blade on the brown citadel              ║
║  So we like to become good at what we do              ║
║  Am I supposed to sound like a nightmare              ║
║  I don't need to watch it last forever                ║
║  When's a girl with the right or wrong                ║
║  What's all those paintings out there?                ║
║  First of all, let me show you the doors              ║
║  The holy synagogue of the old testament              ║
║  They've got the time to get locked in                ║
║  Starlight begins to stream from windows              ║
║  The sound of these endless train wrecks              ║
║  I need you've built me a secret dream                ║
║  Was it supposed to be about your lives?              ║
║  That low wind brings you so much stress              ║ 
║                                                       ║
